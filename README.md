# PhaserFlap
I made this to get some idea on how to build an infiniterunner-esque game on Phaser as well as playing around with animating some custom assets.

# Getting Started
- Install git
    - Installation Guide for [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- Install nodeJS
    - Here's a guide for the [Windows Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
    - Here's a guide for the [Mac Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
- Go to the command line and navigate to the folder you either cloned or downloaded
    - `cd yourFolderName`
- Run `npm install`
    - That should download all the dependencies.

# Running the App
- If you run the command `http-server` in the console it should set the game up on a local server.

# The Game
- The game is a Flappy Bird clone.
- The game just uses the up cursor button. If you successfully avoid the incoming obstacles, you get a point. If you hit an obstacle the game restarts. The player character is constantly falling so you will constantly have to press up to keep the player afloat.

# Built With
- [Phaser](http://phaser.io) - The frameworks for this app.
- NodeJs - To help make the local server.

# Version
- 1.0.0

# Author
- Daniel Hsu - I wrote this and drew/animated the player sprite. 

# Acknowledgment
- This app was made following this [tutorial](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1).
- The basic html template is provided by Phaser.
